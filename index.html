      <p><strong>What the chart represents?</strong></p>
      <p>
        A graph from a 2017 Forbes article titled “How Much Data Is Collected
        Every Minute of the Day?” attempts to showcase the intensity of internet
        usage across the globe. What is interesting about the chart is that it
        quantifies human interaction with the internet via many social media and
        utility platforms at a minute resolution. The chart also indicates the
        growth of the internet population over the years at the bottom.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Idiom Issue:</strong></p>
      <p>
        The choice of chart isn't appropriate for this representation for
        several reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Misleading Channels: At first glance, the chart seems to have five
          channels (name, logo, annotations, pie quadrant, and color), but in
          reality, it only contains two informative channels (Internet
          applications and value count).
        </li>
        <li>
          Failure to Convey Data Trends: The chart fails to clearly convey the
          intensity of the data utilized or the trends in data consumption.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Misleading Elements:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arbitrary use of logos.</li>
        <li>Irregular font sizes.</li>
        <li>Colors that don't categorize similar media types.</li>
        <li>Size of pie quadrants not related to data.</li>
        <li>High ink-to-information ratio.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Data issue:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The value count for all nominal data is unique and non-comparable. For
          example, how can a user compare the number of Tinder swipes with Uber
          rides?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For an apple-to-apple comparison, the data used could be standardized
          to bytes of information transferred each minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Categorizing apps into common groups such as Entertainment, Social,
          Productivity, and Finance, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, a simple line graph or grouped bar graph representing the
          trends in internet usage, with internet population on one axis and
          average data (in units of bytes) per minute on another axis, would be
          better. Coloring the categories could aid in better readability as
          well.

      <p><strong>Carbon emission in London</strong></p>

      <p><strong>What the chart represents?</strong></p>
      <p>
        A data visualization of London's 2019 carbon emissions from different
        land uses, self-made for my master's thesis. The Mayor of London
        provides a dataset pertaining to emissions from various sources such as
        coal, gas, and other sources for land use types residential, commercial,
        and industrial for every fixed square kilometer. This visualization
        overlays all the emissions from various land use types by aggregating
        the emissions from various sources. The radius of the circle maps the
        aggregated value of emissions. The aim of this visualization is to
        present users with information on which part of London emits the most
        carbon.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Idiom Issue:</strong></p>
      <p>
        The representation is not intuitive, as there is no indication of how to
        relate the size of the circles to the quantity of emissions. The choice
        of visualization does not completely aid in objectively answering the
        question of which part of London emits the most carbon. The legends and
        grid information are too small for the screen. The base map consists
        only of the road network of London. The data are visualized based on the
        coordinates provided in the data directly.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Data issue:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The missing data were not treated properly, which misleads that a few
          pockets of the city are emission-free.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Emissions for each planning boundary could have been estimated to
          scientifically infer which zone emits the most carbon.
        </li>
        <li>
          A pie chart within each planning boundary indicating which land use
          category emits the most carbon would have been useful.
        </li>
        <li>Disclose missing data.</li>
      </ul>
